# Amazon-Clone
This is a simple Amazon Clone built using HTML and CSS to replicate the look and feel of the Amazon homepage. It is a frontend-only project that focuses on layout, styling, and responsiveness.
I have also included the images that I have used in this project to give a real touch like Amazon.
Features to enhance user experience :
Responsive design for different screen sizes 📱💻, Amazon-like navbar with logo, search bar, and cart icon 🔍🛍️, Well-structured product sections 🏷️, Footer and category sections similar to Amazon. 

🖼️ Here are some images of this prototype:
